# Syntax is as follows
#
## Inclusion Rules
# Are intended to be followed in order
# + include files matched by pattern in the working directory
# - exclude files matched by pattern from the working directory
#   ** Any files not explicitly matched should fail and trigger a discussion with the component team
#
# Substitute @@product@@ with the product target - http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileOps.html#glob
# * matches only the current directory
# ** matches directory and any subdirectories
#
# TODO, need to work out how to add conditional information.
